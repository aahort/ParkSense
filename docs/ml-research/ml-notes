YOLOv2 model seems fastest for object detection,

Possible Datasets:
    Stanford Cars Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessicali9530/stanford-cars-dataset
    Stanford Cars Dataset (separated by classes) - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jutrera/stanford-car-dataset-by-classes-folder
        - not sure if one would be better than the other, might be more complex working with separated. 
        - tensorflow has a dataset of this preinstalled (tfds.image_classification.Cars196)?
        - 1.85 GB


-GREAT IDEA- add sensors to detect motion and have camera that takes still image for processing
        -better than using video as input which would make it difficult to run model on microprocessor

Research: Convolutional models, existing convolutional models, datasets (train and test)
